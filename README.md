dataframe.ipynb: can run all cells to import, preprocess, and clean data, given the necessary initial excel file from BU Athletics is in the relative file path "../data/BU Athletics Data 22-23.csv"

HS-college-comp.ipynb: can run all cells given dataframe.ipynb exists for generating scatter plots helping to answer baseline questions

GPA-change.ipynb: can run all cells given dataframe.ipynb exists for generating line graph helping to answer baseline questions

Major1.ipynb: can run all cells given dataframe.ipynb exists for generating histograms, line graphs, and box plots exist for answering baseline questions

HSGPA-CGPA.ipynb: can run all cells given relative file path "../data/BU Athletics Data 22-23.csv" exists for generating scatter plots and histograms for answering baseline questions

Language Impact.ipynb: can run all cells given relative file path "../data/BU Athletics Data 22-23.csv" exists for generating box plots and histograms for answering baseline questions

extension-df.ipynb: can run all cells granted the newFeatures.ipynb file exists in the same file and the files "../data/Athletics Annual Surveys Data - 2020-21.csv", "../data/Athletics Annual Surveys Data - 2020-21.csv", and "../data/Athletics Annual Surveys Data - 2020-21.csv" files exist at their relative paths by uploading these files from the survey data frame given to us at the start of the project titled “Athletics Annual Surveys Data” in excel (download the ‘2020-21’, ‘2021-22’, and ‘2022-23’ pages); saves our dataframe for our extension project to the relative file path "../data/dataframe_with_extension.csv"

Polling_analysis.ipynb: can run all cells given "../data/dataframe_with_extension.csv" exists from running extension-df.ipynb for getting correlation of feature graph for extension
